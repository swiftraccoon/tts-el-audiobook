# Versioning Policy for Supreme Rotary Phone

This document outlines the versioning policy and guidelines for the Supreme Rotary Phone project.

## Semantic Versioning

Supreme Rotary Phone follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The version format is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, incrementing as follows:

- `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible API changes,
- `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backward-compatible manner, and
- `PATCH` version when we make backward-compatible bug fixes.

## Version Lifecycle

1. **Development**: New versions start in the development phase. Any new version can undergo changes as needed.

2. **Release Candidate (RC)**: Before a version is officially released, it may go through one or more RC phases. RC versions are for testing; they are close to the final version but may still undergo changes.

3. **Stable Release**: Once a version has passed all tests and reviews, it becomes a stable release. No new features are added to this version; only bug fixes and security patches.

4. **Deprecation**: Older versions are deprecated over time. We encourage users to upgrade to the latest versions for better features and security.

## Reporting Issues and Requesting Features

- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or request features.
- When reporting a bug, mention the version you are using.

## Contributions

- When contributing, ensure your code adheres to the current version's guidelines.
