### Input Handler Module ([input_handler.py](https://github.com/swiftraccoon/tts-el-audiobook/blob/main/tts_el_audiobook/input_handler.py))

#### Description:
This module, `InputHandler`, manages the input operations for the audiobook converter. It parses command line arguments and reads the input file.

#### Key Features:
- Command line argument parsing for file path and TTS options.
- File path validation and file type determination.
- Reading and returning file content along with TTS parameters.

#### Enhancement Ideas:
- Add support for batch processing of multiple files.
- Implement a more robust command-line interface with additional options and help documentation.
- Introduce validation for TTS parameters and better error messages for user guidance.
- Consider integrating a configuration file for default settings.

#### Misc Thoughts:
- The module is well-structured for its purpose, but it could be more user-friendly with detailed help and error messages.
- The reliance on command-line arguments is suitable for advanced users but might be limiting for others.
- The file type validation is a crucial feature, but it could be more comprehensive.
- The code is clean and well-organized, making it easy to understand and modify.
