## Audio Output Module ([audio_output.py](https://github.com/swiftraccoon/tts-el-audiobook/blob/main/tts_el_audiobook/audio_output.py))

## Description:
The `AudioOutput` class in this module is responsible for handling the audio data output. It includes functionality to save the audio data received from the Text-to-Speech API into an audio file.

## Key Features:
- Saving audio data into a specified file format (default is MP3).
- Simple interface for audio file output.

## Enhancement Ideas:
- Add support for different audio formats (e.g., WAV, AAC).
- Implement audio quality settings (bitrate, channels).
- Provide a progress indicator for audio file saving.
- Integrate error handling for file write operations.

## Misc Thoughts:
- The module is straightforward but lacks flexibility in terms of audio formats.
- Error handling is minimal, which might be an issue with file system access.
- The print statement for confirmation could be replaced with a logging mechanism.
- The module could benefit from a more comprehensive approach to audio processing.
