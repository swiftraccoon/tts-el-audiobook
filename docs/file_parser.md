### File Parser Module ([file_parser.py](https://github.com/swiftraccoon/tts-el-audiobook/blob/main/tts_el_audiobook/file_parser.py))

#### Description:
`FileParser` is designed for parsing different file types for the audiobook converter. It currently supports PDF and EPUB formats, with potential for other formats.

#### Key Features:
- Parsing of PDF and EPUB file contents.
- Extraction of text from various document formats.
- Modular design for adding additional file type support.

#### Enhancement Ideas:
- Extend support to other popular formats like MOBI, TXT, and DOCX.
- Implement more sophisticated text extraction techniques, like OCR for scanned PDFs.
- Add error handling for corrupt or unsupported files.
- Introduce parallel processing for faster text extraction in large files.

#### Misc Thoughts:
- The current implementation is basic and could be expanded for broader file format support.
- Error handling seems minimal, which might lead to issues with unexpected file formats or corrupted files.
- The use of external libraries like `PyPDF2` and `ebooklib` is a good choice, but dependency management should be considered.
- The code could benefit from more comments explaining the logic, especially in the parsing functions.
