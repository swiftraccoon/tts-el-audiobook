### Text Processor Module ([text_processor.py](https://github.com/swiftraccoon/tts-el-audiobook/blob/main/tts_el_audiobook/text_processor.py))

#### Description:
The `TextProcessor` class is responsible for processing text extracted from various file formats. It includes functionality for cleaning and preparing the text for text-to-speech conversion.

#### Key Features:
- Processing of extracted text for TTS readiness.
- Operations like trimming whitespace and removing unnecessary characters.

#### Enhancement Ideas:
- Implement advanced text processing features like sentence boundary detection and paragraph formatting.
- Add functionality to handle special characters and non-standard text elements.
- Introduce language detection and handling for multilingual text.
- Provide options for custom text processing rules defined by the user.

#### Misc Thoughts:
- The module currently handles basic text processing, but there's room for more advanced features.
- The simplicity of the `process` method is good for clarity, but it might be too basic for complex text formats.
- Consideration for different languages and character sets would make the module more versatile.
- The code is concise and easy to follow, which is beneficial for maintenance and further development.
