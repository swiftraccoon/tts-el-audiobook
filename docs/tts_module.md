### TTS Module ([tts_module.py](https://github.com/swiftraccoon/tts-el-audiobook/blob/main/tts_el_audiobook/tts_module.py))

#### Description:
`TTSModule` interfaces with the Eleven Lab's Text-to-Speech API to convert processed text into speech. It utilizes the Eleven Labs Python package for API communication.

#### Key Features:
- Conversion of text to speech using Eleven Lab's TTS API.
- Handling of API key and model selection for TTS.
- Chunking of text to fit API limits and combining audio data.

#### Enhancement Ideas:
- Add support for different voices and languages provided by the TTS API.
- Implement a feature to adjust speech parameters like speed and pitch.
- Provide a caching mechanism for repeated text to minimize API calls.
- Integrate a more detailed error handling and logging system.

#### Misc Thoughts:
- The module is well-focused on its primary function but could offer more customization options.
- The handling of API keys and environment variables is crucial and seems well implemented.
- The chunking of text is a practical solution, but it might affect the natural flow of speech in some cases.
- The code is straightforward and follows good programming practices, making it easy to adapt and extend.
