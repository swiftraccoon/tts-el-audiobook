# Contributing to tts-el-audiobook

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL-3.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL-3.0 License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/swiftraccoon/supreme-rotary-phone/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/swiftraccoon/supreme-rotary-phone/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Issue Triage
Here are some tags that we're using to better organize issues in this repo:

* `good first issue` - Good candidates for someone new to the project to contribute.
* `help wanted` - Issues that should be addressed and which we would welcome a
PR for but may need significant investigation or work
* `support` - Request for help with a concept or piece of code but this isn't an
issue with the project.
* `needs more info` - Missing repro steps or context for both project issues \&
support questions.
* `discussion` - Issues where folks are discussing various approaches \& ideas.
* `question` - Something that is a question specifically for the maintainers.
* `documentation` - Relating to improving documentation for the project.
- Browser \& OS-specific tags for anything that is specific to a particular
environment (e.g. `chrome`, `firefox`, `macos`, `android` and so forth).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.
